## Overview

A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the RTSP service of the Tenda CP3 IP camera. When processing the first `SETUP` request, the RTSP service applies a two-stage URL validation mechanism: the first stage performs format checking and rejects malformed inputs with a `400 Bad Request` response; the second stage performs URL routing and path extraction on inputs that pass the first stage. The second-stage parsing logic, however, lacks sufficient length validation on the URL field. By constructing a `SETUP` request URL consisting of exactly four consecutive repetitions of a valid RTSP URL, an attacker can bypass the first-stage format check and trigger a stack buffer overflow during second-stage route parsing, causing an immediate crash of the RTSP service process.

The vulnerability requires no authentication credentials — only network access to the device's LAN segment is necessary. It can be triggered after completing only the `OPTIONS` and `DESCRIBE` handshake, without establishing a full RTSP session. Upon receiving the malformed `SETUP` request, the RTSP service process crashes immediately, causing TCP port 554 to stop accepting connections. All clients on the local network — including the official Tenda app and third-party players such as VLC — are unable to connect to the device. Beyond denial of service, the stack-based nature of the overflow presents a potential attack surface for remote code execution (RCE).

"""
PoC for Stack-Based Buffer Overflow in Tenda CP3 RTSP Service (SETUP Request, Track1)

This proof-of-concept reproduces a denial-of-service vulnerability by sending a
malformed RTSP SETUP request whose URL field consists of exactly four consecutive
repetitions of a valid RTSP URL. This input bypasses the first-stage format
validation and triggers a stack buffer overflow in the second-stage URL routing
parser, causing an immediate crash of the RTSP service process.

Tested device:
  - Vendor:           Tenda
  - Model:            CP3 V3.0
  - Firmware:         V31.1.9.91

Impact:
  - RTSP service process crashes immediately
  - TCP port 554 stops accepting connections
  - Denial of Service (DoS); potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE)

## Attack Demo

The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a malformed RTSP `SETUP` request for the first media track. After completing the `OPTIONS` and `DESCRIBE` handshake with the device, an attacker sends a `SETUP` request whose URL field consists of exactly four consecutive repetitions of a valid RTSP URL. This input bypasses the first-stage format validation and triggers a stack buffer overflow in the second-stage route parsing logic. The RTSP service process crashes immediately upon receiving the malformed request, causing TCP port 554 to stop responding (`ConnectionRefusedError`), and all clients on the local network lose access to the device.

The following is the complete RTSP message sequence used to reproduce the vulnerability:

```
OPTIONS rtsp://<IP>:554/tenda RTSP/1.0
CSeq: 2
User-Agent: LibVLC/3.0.20 (LIVE555 Streaming Media v2016.11.28)

DESCRIBE rtsp://<IP>:554/tenda RTSP/1.0
CSeq: 3
User-Agent: LibVLC/3.0.20 (LIVE555 Streaming Media v2016.11.28)
Accept: application/sdp

SETUP rtsp://<IP>/ch=1?subtype=0/trackID=1rtsp://<IP>/ch=1?subtype=0/trackID=1rtsp://<IP>/ch=1?subtype=0/trackID=1rtsp://<IP>/ch=1?subtype=0/trackID=1 RTSP/1.0
CSeq: 4
User-Agent: LibVLC/3.0.20 (LIVE555 Streaming Media v2016.11.28)
Transport: RTP/AVP/TCP;unicast;interleaved=0-1
```

Note: The `SETUP` request URL is constructed by concatenating exactly four repetitions of the valid RTSP URL `rtsp://<IP>/ch=1?subtype=0/trackID=1`, bypassing first-stage format validation and triggering a stack buffer overflow in the second-stage route parsing logic.

A complete proof-of-concept script and a short demonstration video are provided in this repository to illustrate the reliable reproduction of the issue.

## Supplement

This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker with LAN access to trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected device. By sending a malformed RTSP `SETUP` request for the first media track whose URL consists of exactly four consecutive repetitions of a valid RTSP URL, a stack buffer overflow is triggered during second-stage route parsing, resulting in an immediate RTSP service process crash.

Successful exploitation causes the camera to become completely unavailable, interrupts all video streaming, and results in the device appearing offline in both the official management application and third-party clients. Repeated exploitation can lead to sustained service disruption, negatively impacting the availability and reliability of the device in real-world deployment scenarios. Furthermore, due to the stack-based nature of the overflow, this vulnerability presents a potential attack surface for remote code execution (RCE), posing a significant security risk in real-world deployment scenarios.
