# Tenda CP3 RTSP Service Stack Buffer Overflow via Repeated URL Concatenation in PLAY Request

## Information

**Reported by:**  YanKang

**Affected products:** CP3 V3.0

## Overview

A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the RTSP service of the Tenda CP3 IP camera. When processing a `PLAY` request, the RTSP service applies a two-stage URL validation mechanism: the first stage performs format checking and rejects malformed inputs with a `400 Bad Request` response; the second stage performs URL routing and path extraction on inputs that pass the first stage. The second-stage parsing logic, however, lacks sufficient length validation on the URL field. By constructing a `PLAY` request URL consisting of exactly five consecutive repetitions of a valid RTSP URL, an attacker can bypass the first-stage format check and trigger a stack buffer overflow during second-stage route parsing, causing an immediate crash of the RTSP service process.

The vulnerability requires no authentication credentials — only network access to the device's LAN segment is necessary. Exploitation requires completing the `OPTIONS`, `DESCRIBE`, and two legitimate `SETUP` requests to establish a valid RTSP session, after which the malformed `PLAY` request can be sent to trigger the overflow. Upon receiving the malformed request, the RTSP service process crashes immediately, causing TCP port 554 to stop accepting connections. All clients on the local network — including the official Tenda app and third-party players such as VLC — are unable to connect to the device. Beyond denial of service, the stack-based nature of the overflow presents a potential attack surface for remote code execution (RCE).

"""
PoC for Stack-Based Buffer Overflow in Tenda CP3 RTSP Service (PLAY Request)

This proof-of-concept reproduces a denial-of-service vulnerability by completing
a legitimate RTSP handshake (OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, and two valid SETUP requests)
to establish a valid session, then sending a malformed PLAY request whose URL
field consists of exactly five consecutive repetitions of a valid RTSP URL. This
input bypasses the first-stage format validation and triggers a stack buffer
overflow in the second-stage URL routing parser, causing an immediate crash of
the RTSP service process.

Tested device:
  - Vendor:           Tenda
  - Model:            CP3 V3.0
  - Firmware:         V31.1.9.91

Impact:
  - RTSP service process crashes immediately
  - TCP port 554 stops accepting connections
  - Denial of Service (DoS); potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE)

## Attack Demo

The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a malformed RTSP `PLAY` request. After completing the `OPTIONS`, `DESCRIBE`, and two legitimate `SETUP` requests to establish a valid RTSP session, an attacker sends a `PLAY` request whose URL field consists of exactly five consecutive repetitions of a valid RTSP URL. This input bypasses the first-stage format validation and triggers a stack buffer overflow in the second-stage route parsing logic. The RTSP service process crashes immediately upon receiving the malformed request, causing TCP port 554 to stop responding (`ConnectionRefusedError`), and all clients on the local network lose access to the device.

## Supplement

This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker with LAN access to trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected device. By sending a malformed RTSP `PLAY` request whose URL consists of exactly five consecutive repetitions of a valid RTSP URL, a stack buffer overflow is triggered during second-stage route parsing, resulting in an immediate RTSP service process crash.

Successful exploitation causes the camera to become completely unavailable, interrupts all video streaming, and results in the device appearing offline in both the official management application and third-party clients. Repeated exploitation can lead to sustained service disruption, negatively impacting the availability and reliability of the device in real-world deployment scenarios. Furthermore, due to the stack-based nature of the overflow, this vulnerability presents a potential attack surface for remote code execution (RCE), posing a significant security risk in real-world deployment scenarios.
