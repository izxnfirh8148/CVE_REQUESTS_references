## Overview

An improper input handling vulnerability exists in the RTSP service of the Tenda CP3 IP camera. When the RTSP service receives a request in which the URL field or any header field value exceeds a certain length threshold, the service does not return any RTSP-layer error response. Instead, it abruptly terminates the connection at the TCP layer by sending a `RST` packet, leaving the client with no application-layer indication of why the request was rejected.

Per RFC 2326, a server that cannot process a received request is required to return an appropriate RTSP error response code — such as `400 Bad Request` or `413 Request Entity Too Large` — before closing the connection. By bypassing the application-layer response and forcing disconnection at the transport layer, the affected device's behavior does not conform to the RFC 2326 specification. This non-conformant behavior may cause clients to enter an undefined state, interfere with session management logic in automated systems, and complicate fault diagnosis in deployment environments where the cause of connection termination cannot be determined from the application layer.

## POC

```python

"""
PoC for Improper Handling of Oversized Field Values in Tenda CP3 RTSP Service

This proof-of-concept demonstrates a non-conformant behavior in the RTSP service
of the Tenda CP3 IP camera. When a request containing an oversized field value is
received, the device abruptly terminates the TCP connection with a RST packet
without returning any RFC 2326-compliant RTSP error response.

The example below uses an oversized URL field value in the second SETUP request.
The same behavior can be reproduced by supplying oversized values in the URL field
or any header field value of other RTSP requests.

Tested device:
  - Vendor:           Tenda
  - Model:            CP3 V3.0
  - Firmware:         V31.1.9.91

Observed behavior:
  - Device sends TCP RST and closes the connection immediately
  - No RTSP error response is returned (e.g. 400 Bad Request or 413 Request Entity Too Large)
  - RTSP service process remains operational; TCP port 554 continues to accept connections

## Attack Demo

The issue can be observed by sending an RTSP request containing an oversized field value. The example below uses an oversized URL field value in the second `SETUP` request, where a string of 10000 bytes is appended to the URL. Upon receiving this request, the device immediately terminates the TCP connection with a `RST` packet without returning any RTSP error response. The subsequent service check confirms that the RTSP service process itself remains operational and continues to accept new connections normally.

## Supplement

This vulnerability reflects an improper input handling behavior in the RTSP service of the affected device. When oversized field values are received, the service silently drops the connection at the TCP layer without providing any RFC 2326-compliant error response, leaving clients unable to determine the cause of the failure at the application layer. The same non-conformant behavior can be reproduced by supplying oversized values in the URL field or any header field value across different RTSP request types.

While the RTSP service process itself remains operational after each such event and continues to serve other clients, this non-conformant behavior may introduce risks in real-world deployment scenarios. Automated monitoring systems and client applications that rely on application-layer error codes for session management and fault recovery may enter undefined or inconsistent states when encountering abrupt TCP RST terminations. This behavior deviates from the robustness requirements outlined in RFC 2326 and may negatively impact the reliability and interoperability of the device in production environments.
